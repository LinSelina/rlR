# Theoretical part
- how to evaluate the exploration? Entropy based method
- Implement entropy as a criteria for exploration
- instance selection in replay instead of variable selection? analyze which instance has been selected throughout the replay and propose balanced replay strategy or important sampling.

# Practical part
- consistent database for storing experience
- Shiny app for visualization of state value space and action value space
- Compare the performance of post-learning(mlr) and online learning
- Shiny app for visualizing Atari Games(python/R integration)
- record experience into video
- implementing different backends (GPU)
- the store persitence and reapplication of the brain

# Hard topic
- tensor polydidadic decomposition to $Q(s,a,t)$
